# weather-app
A basic weather application I am building to learn how to use an API.

I am currently learning how to use APIs, so this project will be based around building a very simple web application that grabs information about
the weather in a given location using an open-source weather API. Once that is done, I will be trying to use the Geolocation API to grab the user's
location for the initial look when the application first loads.
